# Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) for Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm for minimizing the Rastrigin and Sphere functions.

## Introduction

Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that mimics the social behavior of grey wolves. This implementation focuses on minimizing the Rastrigin and Sphere functions.

## Usage

To use the GWO algorithm, you can import the provided module and call the `gwo` function with the desired fitness function, maximum iterations, number of wolves, and other parameters.

## Function Definitions

### Rastrigin Function

The Rastrigin function is defined as:

```python
def fitness_rastrigin(position):
    # ... (implementation)


)
